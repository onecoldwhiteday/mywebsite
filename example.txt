Hi! I’m Kate and I’m experienced frontend developer. My primary specialization is psd 
to html work. I’m proficient with html & css technologies ( including html5, css3 & jQuery,
 JS ), frameworks ( bootstrap, foundation, etc ) and methodologies ( BEM, HDD, etc ). 
 Familiar with all kind of pre-processors and assets builders like gulp.

I always aim to deliver high quality result which implies clean and maintainable code, 
pixel perfect and responsive layouts.
